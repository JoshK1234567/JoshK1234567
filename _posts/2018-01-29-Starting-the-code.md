    <td>For the majority of the lesson we listened as our teacher gave us a kickstart on how to make/code our buzzfeed quiz which we had planned last lesson. First he reminded us how to use def (define) and showed us the function array.append, he explained how appendix means added information (the definition is: "a section or table of subsidiary matter at the end of a book or document").</td>

    <td>It was a fairly long time to listen for, especially as there were lots of small details which you had to pay close attention to in order to be able to correctly code our game. I need to work on being able to remember code and not forget about it so I can work more productively. It helped a lot when the teacher put some coding on google classroom to allow us to refer back to it in the future.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will ask more questions if it would allow me to remember and to get a better understanding of the code which we are using. Also I will take notes which will give me better resources to refer back to when I'm stuck. To conclude I need to continue to keep focus during lessons to achieve great things in IT. </td>

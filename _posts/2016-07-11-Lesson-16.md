Today in IT we finished off discussing about good and bad things social media gives you. 

But then we were given microbits so we can download our game coding which we created using  [https://www.microbit.co.uk/](https://www.microbit.co.uk/) which is free to use. All we had to do was to plug the microbit into the computer and then click compile on the microbit website. Before I did this I added some things to my code and tweeked it a bit so I was sure my microbit would work how I planned it to. I created my game (Snap) by using random numbers to select what pattern would appear on screen.

For homework we are justmaking sure the game is uploaded and making our game as good as it can be.

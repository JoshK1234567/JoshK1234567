Starting point: pg 10

Target for lesson:To complete the first section

Did I achieve my target:I achieved my target however I think I could have done more                if I had read the booklet in detail.

I did a lot of trial and error which did work but took some time to get to the final outcome. Next time will be much easier because I will know more about the programme and how to work it. This will allow me to follow the instructions better because I will know the layout and where all the tools are. I also learnt by just reading and looking at the booklet. Also by having someone read the book to me I found it easier to understand.

I think if I had been more efficient with setting up then I could've started earlier. This would've allowed me to get more done so I would not have just reached my target but achieved more. Additionally I need to focus on reading slightly ahead on the booklet because it might explain what I am doing wrong. This will make me a more independent learner and also allow me to get more work done.

In the future I will improve my learning by: remembering what I have learnt previously and including that knowledge, read and understand what I am reading (in the booklet), be more efficient/orginased at setting up and reading ahead if I get stuck so I can figure out where I went wrong.

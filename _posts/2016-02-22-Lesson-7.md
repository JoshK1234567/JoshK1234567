Over the past few months we have discussed a lot about Social Media, about what you should or should not post, what is inappropriate, offensive or just stupid. We also learnt that you must be careful when using social media because there is no sarcastic tone in words it's only how you say them so what you interpret as a joke could be taken the wrong way. We made a list of rules of which you should follow in order to stay safe and that you should think about what you just typed before clicking the post button. We understood that you should only post what you would say to someone's face. Although some of us had previously learnt how to be safe on social media, it is always good to recap because one click could change your life forever.

However much people tell you about social media and how to be safe it is always up to you whether you take the advice or not.

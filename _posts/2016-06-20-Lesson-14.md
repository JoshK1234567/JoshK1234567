Today in IT I learnt that in my blogs I should include more about what I learnt and not about what I did. We also continued with our own micro bit game. I figured out why my game wasn't working and I fixed it by adding While true loops. I then added extra levels and a system, that if you fail, you restart. I did that by copying the game to snippets, which allowed me to add it easily at any point.

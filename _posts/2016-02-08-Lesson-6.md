Today we discussed that your social media can show a different version of you. This is often caused by what you post, for example if you only posted pictures of you at a disco (drunk), then people may think you're an alcoholic or someone who doesn't make the most of their life. It is important to show you true identity because anyone could find that picture of you seriously drunk and make fun of you. Make sure that you don't post anything that a person that you respect (e.g your mum or teacher) would hold against you.

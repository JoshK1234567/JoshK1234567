    <td>In todays lesson we started the first piece of work in IT in for year 9. We were aiming to encrypt messages usinbg google sheets. We leant a formula called VLOOKUP, this stands for vertical search so it searches columns. There wasnt much searching stratergies as all you had to do was remember the shape of the formula and fill in the gaps. This is what I typed in to find the encrypted version of a letter: =VLOOKUP(D2,$A$1:$B$27,2)   </td>

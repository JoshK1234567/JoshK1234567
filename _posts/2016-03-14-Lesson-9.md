Today we talked about presentations. Definition from google: a speech or talk in which a new product, idea, or piece of work is shown and explained to an audience. We then visited a website called Prezi which is really cool. There is so much opportunity and it's easy to use. It is free and is used for all sorts of things ranging from a presentation about who should own a multi billion pound company or just a presentation at school about your holiday.

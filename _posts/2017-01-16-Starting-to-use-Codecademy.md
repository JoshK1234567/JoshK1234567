    <td>This lesson we started to learn more code on a different website however I couldn't do the usual stratery of one person reading while the other types, this was because we were working on our own. Instead I just read the instructions multiple times over (if i get stuck) and then remember what peice of code I wil need to complete the tasks</td>

    <td>I think that because it was my first time working on Codecademy it took a while to get use to the way it worked and the way I would need to work. Additionaly we were completing the Python code section, despite it being the easiest one it still proved to be reasonably difficult to learn what symbols represented what especially in the Maths section.</td>

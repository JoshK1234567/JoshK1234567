Today we continued using micro bit and following the cook book tutorials for Java script. We learnt the importance of not just following the tutorials but understanding them too. By understanding the tutorials it will allow me to be able to make my own coding. Going through the tutorials it has been increasingly quicker to completwe due to the fact that I have increased my knowledge on coding.

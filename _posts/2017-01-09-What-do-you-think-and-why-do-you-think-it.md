When a teacher asks a question do you put your hand up straight away? Maybe you look around to see if other people put their hands up? Or maybe you don't put your hand up incase you will embarrass yourself by getting the question wrong? Why? Often it is to do with past experiences and how you have been laughed at because you got a question wrong. 

Today we watched a video which featured a young boy atempting to jump over a vault. He failed the first time, however his teacher insisted for him to keep trying. Each time he took a run up his classmates cheered though when he failed they went silent, not booing or laughing. Eventualy he completed the vault and he was greeted with a huge applause. This story shows that despite how hard you try and despite how many times you fail you should still perservere because eventually you will nail it and it is then when you realise how you have truely accomplished something.

This links to ICT and other subjects within school and within life in general. We are currently doing coding in IT and with this new language to learn it is important that we perservere in order to accomplish all that is expected and much more!

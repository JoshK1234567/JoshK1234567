Today in IT we talked about and reviewed some people's prezi presentation about the history of computers that we were set for homework over the easter break. Doing this project meant we learnt a lot about the history of computers, ranging from pocket calculators that we use in school today to huge codebreaking computers that gave us the upper hand in WWII. 

We learnt how to improve our Prezis and that will be what we are doing for homework this week.

  <tr>
    <td>To begin the lesson we all went to: https://www.buzzfeed.com/?utm_term=.ug5KLqW7ED#.ivwBvR20xm. We each found a quiz and took mental notes of the types of questions which the quizes tended to answer. Such as: What Kind Of Chocolate Are You? and Are Your Hygiene Habits Gross Or Normal? From many different examples I wrote my own question which is: Are You A Pensioner? You have to answer a variety of questions which will give away whether you are a pensioner or not.

  <tr>
    <td>The main factor which possibly had an effect on my learning and my choice of question was the fact that people around me were constantly coming up with new questions which made it hard to choose one for myself however I managed to. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>I need to continue to keep focus during lessons to achieve great things in IT and in future be able to keep focus on my own problem.</td>

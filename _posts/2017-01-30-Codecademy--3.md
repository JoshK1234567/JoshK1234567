    <td>I think the main reason why I didn't complete the 10 sections which I hoped to complete was because as I work through the python code section it gets harder meaning more time and effort is needed, therefore I don’t complete that many exercises. I did occasionaly ask people for a hint on how to complete the task because often I didn’t get the code right first time. So I tried multiple times and read the question through once more. Occasionally I had to use the hint which is provided if you get stuck.</td>

    <td>Not much limited my learning however sometimes I felt like I wouldn’t be able to complete the codeing which was infront of me. I did though in the end complete the work despite not reaching my personal target.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>I need to continue to keep focus during lesson to achieve great things in IT. Additionaly I need to remember each part of codeing which I learn so that I don’t get stuck on something I should know.</td>

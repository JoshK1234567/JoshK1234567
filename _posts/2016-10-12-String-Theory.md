Starting point: Section 3 pg 28

Target for this lesson: To finish this section

Did I reach my target: No

I think our most effective strategy was too have one person read the coding steps booklet out at a slow pace so the other person can type up the necessary information. This sped up the process. Also we checked our code before running it so we could test our knowledge and figure out the mistakes before the computer tells us them.

Our monitor was zoomed in making it hard to navigate and view our work. However we did figure out how to shrink text to make moving around the software more efficient.I think this small issue slowed our working pace down as we spent time trying to solve the problem. Next time we might ask for help. Possibly if we used our resources we might have found a soloution.

Next time I don't think we should set such a high starting point because despite having our monster zoomed in the stages/chapters in the coding booklet are getting longer so saying that we hope to complete the current chapter from the beginning will be hard even with good learning strategies. Additionally, next time I will be more confident with what I type so I'm not constantly going back to check that I've typed the correct code.

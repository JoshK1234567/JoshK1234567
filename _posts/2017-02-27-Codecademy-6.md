    <td>This lesson I started at 23% and passed my target of 27% with 28%. Next lesson I will start and hopefully complete the functions section. The definition given by codecademy is "A function is a reusable section of code written to perform a specific task in a program." I completed the 5% between 23 and 28 as homework because I spent most of the lesson trying to isert a table into my blog so it looks good.</td>

    <td>I was focused during the lesson and I have remembered most of what our teacher had told us about the layout of my blogs. I should already have the table in my blogs however I haven't done so yet.</td>

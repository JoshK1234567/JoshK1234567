    <td>At the start of the lesson we were given a demonstration on how using def (define) you can complete relatively simple maths equations. Here is my code https://repl.it/@joshking/Maths-using-def . We used def to declare the functions which we were using. I followed that up with "main():" to give me “def main():” after that I had to end the piece of code with main(). </td>

    <td>Often whilest completing the task it was easy for me to be tempted to copy some of the code however by copying some of the code straight of the board allowed me to understand the main parts of the code.</td>

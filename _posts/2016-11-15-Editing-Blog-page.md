This week we set up our fuze boxes as usual however it turned out we didn't need them because throughout the whole lesson we edited our blog page to the best of our abilities. We did this so we could achieve the best possible score when our page is marked. 

We checked the following:

Appearance (looks good)

Quantity of work

Quality of work

Easy to read (colour scheme)

I first went to check the quantity and quality of my posts and I believe those sections of my work were good. However when I looked at the appearance I realized that the apearance was quite basic and simple. I had only been using a few colours and I thought to my self that my blog page is quite boring sooâ€¦ I set out to make my blog interesting. Soon I descovered that my background could be an image. It took me the majority of the lesson to set my background. At first I just used trial and error method but then I figured out that I would need some more knowledge to reset my background. I spent a while researching and the answers weren't on the google slides which we were given to us so that we could figure stuff out for ourselves. However I found the code I needed and now my blog looks alright.

Starting point: pg 44

Target for this lesson? Do as much as we possibly can.

Did I reach my target?  We reached pg 47 which is only 3 pages but it was still a lot of coding.

How did I learn? What strategies were effective?

As a group me and my partner did our best to learn as much as we can in the 1 hour lesson which we are given. Yet again my partner and I used the very effective strategy of one person reading the other typing, not only is this efficient but it also allows both the reader and the types to understand the code. This is instead of one persons copying down the code whilst the other one gets bored and messes around.

What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?

I've set many targets so far this term whilst completing the coding booklet. Some targets were complex and some were vague and as I get closer to the end of the book I have been setting more vague targets, I think this is because the coding within the sections are getting longer and longer. I am unsure whether this allows me to learn more or it limits my learning.

What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?

I have the same target as last time: I need to continue to keep focus during lesson to achieve great things in IT.

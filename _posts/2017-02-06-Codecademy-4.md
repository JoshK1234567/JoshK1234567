    <td>Today I set a smaller target than last week because the exercises were getting harder meaning it took more time to complete a section.I am currently on the Conditionals & Control Flow section which requires quite a lot of boolean operator. If i got stuck I would try multiple times and read the question through once more. Occasionally I had to use the hint which is provided if you get stuck.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Not much limited my learning however a couple of time the look of the code was quite off putting and made me not want to do it also sometime I just thought I couldn't do it however I did figure out what code was required. I did though in the end complete the work despite not reaching my personal target.</td>

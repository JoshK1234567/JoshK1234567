In today's lesson we focused on the uses of social media. We ended up with creating a large list of what we believed social media was used for. Then we put the negative uses in one box and the positive uses in another. Just like below.

Advertising                                                 Stalking

Chatting                                                      Pervert                                                     

Sharing                                                       Paedophile

Trans national comms                                 Porn and revenge porn

Government security checks                       sexting

Background checks 

Etc.

I learnt that although you always here about the negative stuff, positive things heavely out weigh the bad things.  

We then went on and talked about Revenge porn and sexting. 

SEXTING

send (someone) sexually explicit photographs or messages via mobile phone.

"older teens are more likely to engage in sexting than their younger counterparts"

Google definition

REVENGE PORN

The publication of explicit material portraying someone who has not consented for the image or video to be shared. The law now makes it illegal to disclose a "private sexual photograph or film" without the consent of the person depicted in the content, and with the intent to cause them distress.

For homework we found newsarticles on both sexting and revenge porn.

Starting point: Start of the section True or False

Target for this lesson?: To finish this section.

Did I reach my target?: Yes.

How did I learn? What strategies were effective? 

In today's lesson yet again we got out the fuze boxes and the other equipment which includes a mouse, power cable and a monster. We got straight to work wiping out the booklet and finding the section which we had to do. We switched round the job of typing and reading out the code however at some points we got stuck and we would have to read some extra information in great depth.

What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? 

We got distracted multiple times during the lesson as many people have got on to the stage when they use the robot arm and control it with code which they type into the fuze box. This distracted us a great deal and therefore slowed down our work progress however we did get all the work that we set ourselves done.

What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?

I need to continue to keep focus during lesson to achieve great things in IT. We also need to speed up our work rate as we feel that we are falling behind on the amount of work which we need to complete within the booklet.

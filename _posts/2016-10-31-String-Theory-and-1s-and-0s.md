Starting point: half way through the string Theory section.

Target for this lesson: To finish this section and start the next.

Did I reach my target: Yes

Yet again my partner and I used the very effective strategy of one person reading the other typing. Allowing us to accomplish more and to achieve more than what we had predicted. By having multiple lessons on coding so far we have settled nicely into a routine. First you set up your moniter and computer and then you set you set your targets and start from where you finished last. This allowed all groups to work at there own pace I believe this allows us student to get the most out of IT lessons.

Setting up still limits my learning as it can often be chaos getting the equipment which is needed for the lesson. I think all groups have this problem however there might be a way to be quicker by first heading to get the equipment which is less crowded and then head off to get the other equipment.

I need to continue to keep focus during lesson to achieve great things in IT.

    <td>In todays lesson we set out on creating a virtual shop using Google Sheets. To start I created a table showing Items (clothing) and their prices. This included no code at all. Next I created an almost exact copy of the first table however i did not write in the price but I used code so that the item's price was looked up and found in the previous table. I used "=VLOOKUP" and the code looked like this: =VLOOKUP(E2,A2:B6,2,false). For each item the coding ould change slightly. As soon as I had that in place no matter what item I put in the column prior to the code a price would come up.

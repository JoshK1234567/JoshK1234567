    <td>This lesson I started at 19% of the way through the Python code course, on codeacademy, by reaching 23% by the end of the lesson it meant I had started the Pyglatin section.The Control flow section taught me how to write code which will allow a computer to choose among outcomes based off what else is happening in the code. I used the key words if, else and elif.</td>

    <td>I was reasonably focused during the lesson and the people around me didn't distract me. I need to work on reading the question for a second time because often I think I know what is being asked but then I read the question again and realise what I have to do.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I need to continue to keep focus during lessons to achieve great things in IT. Additionaly, I need to remember everything I learnt in the conditionals & control flow section as I believe it will come handy in the future exercises.</td>

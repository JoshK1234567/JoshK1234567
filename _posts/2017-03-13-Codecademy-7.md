    <td>This lesson I started at 28% and expected to reach a target of 32% however soon, during the begining of the lesson, it appeared that I was far behind so I achieved more and reached 38%. This section included a lot of functions as there are one of the bases of code. Therefor we started by reviewing my function work. I only needed a small amount of code:

def answer():
    anwer = 42
    return 42

By the end of the Lesson I had to type this code:

def hotel_cost (nights):
    return 140 * nights
def plane_ride_cost (city):
    if city == "Charlotte":
        return 183
    elif city == "Tampa":
        return 220
    elif city == "Pittsburgh":
        return 222
    elif city == "Los Angeles":
        return 475
def rental_car_cost (days):
    if days < 3:
        return 40 * days
    elif days > 6:
        return 40 * days - 50
    else:
        return 40 * days - 20
def trip_cost (city, days, spending_money):
    return rental_car_cost(days) + hotel_cost (days) + plane_ride_cost (city) + spending_money

print trip_cost ("Los Angeles", 5, 600)

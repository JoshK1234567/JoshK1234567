    <td>I learnt how simple it was to create shapes using code. We used a simple piece of code which allowed us to make a variety of shapes easily. The code which we used was:
def draw_shape(sides,length):
  for i in range(sides):
    t.forward(length)
    t.left(360/sides)

This defined draw_shape which then allowed us to create a shape by typing:
  draw_shape(4,100)
This created a square.

For the rest of the lesson we messed around with patterns and making cool shapes. I figured out how to customise my "turtle". I used this code:
t = turtle.Turtle()
t.color("red")
t.shape("turtle")
t.speed(1000)
This made my “turtle”: the shape of a turtle, it made it red and made the speed of my turtle 100. At the top of this code I had typed t = turtle.Turtle() this just allowed me to refer to the turtle as “t”.

    <td>Next time I will try to find out more code which I could include in my coding inorder to learn extra. To conclude I need to continue to keep focus during lessons to achieve great things in IT.

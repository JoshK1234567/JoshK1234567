1.The image above shows the first question I did for this diary. The writing on the side is        talking about dictionaries and what I had to do is print the values of Sloth and Burmese Python. Therefor I used a sort of idictionary which in this case was called residents so I entered print residents['Sloth']

print residents['Burmese Python']

Sloth and Burmese Python being the names of the values.

2. The Next question I was asked to make a dictionary. I had to right a menu which comprised of three different food which different prices (values). My added code was:

menu = {'Chicken Alfredo': 14.50, 'Spam': 2.50, 'Sausage': 1.20, 'Potato': 4.90}

Day 2

1.The first task which I was set to complete today was called Changing Your Mind. It was to do with deleting parts of code with a piece of code. Because dictionaries are changeable, they can be edited in many different ways. I learnt that Items can be removed from a dictionary with:

Del (name of dictionary) ["item"]

I was asked to delete the items Sloth and Bengal Tiger. I did this comfotably.

2.The Next task I was showed a different way of removing an item from a list.

(list name).remove("item")

With the peice of code which I just learnt I completed the question swiftly.

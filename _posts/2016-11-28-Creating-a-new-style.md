The majority of this lesson I spent editing this blog page on github. I have added a border/text box to add more structure to my blogs. I then had to change the background because the colour of the text box was clashing with the background making it harder to read. Once I had finished editing my style of this blog.

I didn't achieve much this lesson however I did learn a great deal and feel more confident with editing the style of this blog page. Additionally I am more proud of my work which I post on this website due to the effort and lesson time I have put into not only the style but also the quality and quantity of the blogs themselves.

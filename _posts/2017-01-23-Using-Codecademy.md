    <td>This lesson we continued to work on codecademy. I worked on my own for most of the lesson but I did accasionaly ask people for a hint on how to complete the task. I predominatly got the code right first time however when I didn't I tried multiple times and read the question through once more. Occasionally I had to use the hint which is provided if you get stuck. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>A couple of times I was told the answer instead of being told how to do it or being helped. Our teacher said that often people mistake helping people by giving them the answer. During the rest of the lesson we then were carefull about what we did when the person next to us asked for help.</td>

    <td>Next time I will be more aware of how to help someone when they ask for help and I will make sure that as soon as I log on I start whatever work is expected to be done during the lesson.</td>

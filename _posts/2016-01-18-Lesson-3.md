Today we learnt that adverts and reality tv show are not always realistic even though the show is classified as reality tv. By watching people do stunts on tv it inspires you to do the same, but what you don't think about is that when the actor performs that stunt he is surrounded by professional safety teams. Sometimes you just need to stop and think for a second, *Is this really possible?*

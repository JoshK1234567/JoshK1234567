    <td>In the last couple of weeks we have continued with work on encryption. We have concaternated our previous message  and labelled lines:coded message (contains the concaternated code which is "=CONCATENATE(D5:Z5)"), program, Left, Factor, Switch I/O, Split and Decode. The coding which we include in each section allows any message which is type in to be decoded.   </td>

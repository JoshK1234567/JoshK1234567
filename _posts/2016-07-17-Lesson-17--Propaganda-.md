In today's lesson we talked about propaganda, although we had learnt about advertising techniques earlier this year.  We learnt a lot about what different news papers would say/write about an event that has happened. For example they might exagerate the situation or include some information about someones religion (not relevant to the event), just to stir up trouble and to catch the buyers attention. For homework we are to find 2 examples online and write about them.

Example one

**BBC News (website)**: "Turkey purge after coup attempy". They have a picture of soldiers                        surrendering.

**Daily Mail (website)**: "FIGHT FOR TURKEY". They show pictures of men fighting.

There is a huge contrast between these two websites. The daily mail is showing viewers more graphical content to attract/intrege people. However, the BBC News website is more cautious and have not posted potentially upsetting and worrying images on main part of their homepage. I beleive in this instance the daily mail is potentially trying to "stir up trouble".

Example two - The Sun

SELFIE MURDER: "Evil brother strangled 'Pakistan's Kim Kardashianâ€™ in honour killing for taking too many raunchy Facebook snaps". The first point I am going to make is that the crime has nothing to do with the fact that the man was Pakistani. This means that the Sun is making people think that people from Pakistan want to kill their sister.

Conclusion

From this homework I have learnt that many newspapers and other news related things exagerate events, causing hatred. I have also learnt that people must be more careful with what sources you get the news from.
